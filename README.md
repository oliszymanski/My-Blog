# My-Blog


description: <br>
My personal blog that I have built myself. I write blog posts about 
what I have done lately, where I was and what I learned. Some tutorials will also be
seen here!


Note: this is my first blog, so I will try to do my best to make
changes for better UX/UI, because I'm not that good at creating content
yet. Go ahead and issue if something is wrong with it. Thanks!
